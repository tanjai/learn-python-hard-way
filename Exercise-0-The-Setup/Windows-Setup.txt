Go to http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ with your browser, get the Notepad++ text editor, and install it. You do not need to be the administrator to do this.

Make sure you can get to Notepad++ easily by putting it on your desktop and/or in Quick Launch. Both options are available during setup.

Run PowerShell from the Start menu. Search for it and you can just press Enter to run it.

Make a shortcut to it on your desktop and/or Quick Launch for your convenience.

Run your PowerShell program (which I will call Terminal later). It won't look like much.

In your PowerShell (Terminal) program, run python. You run things in Terminal by just typing the name and pressing Enter.

If you run python and it's not there (python is not recognized..). Install it from http://python.org/download.

Make sure you install Python 2, not Python 3.

You may be better off with ActiveState Python especially when you do not have Administrative rights

If after you install it python still isn't recognized then in PowerShell enter this:

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27", "User")

Close PowerShell and then start it again to make sure Python now runs. If it doesn't, restart may be required.

Type quit() and press Enter to exit python.

You should be back at a prompt similar to what you had before you typed python. If not, find out why.

Go back to PowerShell (Terminal) using just the keyboard to switch windows. up if you can't figure it out.

Back in PowerShell (Terminal), list the directory to see your newly created file.
